Team details:
                  NAME                   USN
               -Kiran v dambal        1KS18CS033
               -Maharaj s             1KS18CS043

Contribution of team members:-

 Both of us equally given our efferts for finding the efficent output of this program.
 taht is,
	-Kiran, given the efficent way to create the program and helped in understanding the concept of matrix, 
	 which is applied to solve the peoblrm. given the idea and conditions of printing the required pattern.
	-maharaj, analysed the program and given the concept of printing forward diagonals also helped to avoid 
	 even numbers as input. 

Instructions to run the program:-

	Actually we used the command line arguments in our program. And by the help of this we can run our program
	in the CMD judt by typing the file name and input separated by space.
			
		Eg:-
		     filename	input
		     asn0112    21

Detils on example invocation and output:-
	
	 For example for 
		N = 15, following should be output.

Challenges faced:-

	Initially, we were not able to understand the concept to be applied to print the required pattern, but later by applying 
	the matrix conept and continious efforts we got the required solution. but still we had soome errors which were debuged 
	later by tracing the program.
	finaly by our team cordination and hard work we sucesfully creted the efficent program.

Things we learnt from our assignment:-

	This assignment helped us to understand the use of time complexity and we both shared our thoughts and ideaswhile creating 
	the program.we also learnt how to use command line argument.
